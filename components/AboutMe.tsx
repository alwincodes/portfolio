                I have done several web projects for academic purposes and as a
                hobby, I have used Java EE, Node.js, Python for creating backend
                servers and API endpoints (RESTfull and GraphQl). For the
                frontend, I have worked with React, Next.js, and Gatsby for
                creating client-side rendered, server-side rendered, and
                statically generated applications, HTML5, CSS3 for creating
                static pages, and JSON and XML for sending and receiving data
            </p>
            <h4>Databases</h4>
            <p>
                I have experience with MySql, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis,
                these technologies are incorporated in some of my personal
                projects
